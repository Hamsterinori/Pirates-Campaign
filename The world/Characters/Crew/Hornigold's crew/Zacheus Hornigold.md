- possibly the reason Ben and Henry broke up was due to their status? Henry was a rich fuck while Ben was not and Ben felt that Henry viewed him as "beneath him" and "uneducated"?
- Zacheus hates Henry because he turned his father to piracy (and homosexuality) which led to his mother leaving them. He never said anything outloud but he started sowing seeds of doubt into both of their minds and eventually convinced his father that Henry sees him as someone beneath him and convinced Henry that his father only wanted him for his money. When the whole thing culminated in the two of them breaking up, Zacheus snuck to the port and after Ben left Henry's ship, he set it ablaze
