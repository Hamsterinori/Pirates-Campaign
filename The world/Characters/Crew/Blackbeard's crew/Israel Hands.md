**Background:**
- Mladý average vysoký spratek se středně dlouhýma černýma vlasama a modrýma očima, strniště
- Tetování “x” na lícní kosti, vlaštovka na horní straně dlaně 
- Blackbeardův guard dog basically, always ready to bite; born to a prostitute, he grew up on the streets of Bristol, became a sailor at the tender age of 10, sailed to Bahamas where he was picked up by Blackbeard when he was about 13 and quickly climbed up the rank to become his first mate
- Blackbeard’s second in command, incredibly loyal, knows BB doesn’t kill and kills for him to keep the secret
- "God's perfect little soldier", does anything BB asks him to
- BB calls him “Basil”, the people sometimes call him "The Undertaker" or “Blackbeard’s Dog”
- Is thankful to Blackbeard for picking him up from the streets and kinda views him as a father figure (BB is his actual father but neither of them knows that. Izzy knows that his father was a sailor and his name was Edward Drummond but what he doesn’t know is that Ed Drummond was BB’s fake name that he used to use in port when he was still in the navy)
- His mother’s name was Katherine Hands
- If BB dies at some point in the story, Izzy will take up the mantle of Blackbeard and spread rumours of BB's ghost coming back for revenge. He's also going to be more cruel than BB. Bonus points for acquiring BB’s actual skull and mounting it somewhere on the ship.
- Due to his position, he often acts older than he actually is, generally serious and kinda grumpy, known to have no problems with killing for Blackbeard
- Brat alert
- Was accidentally shot in the knee by Blackbeard so now limps (not yet, later)
- Vždycky má někde schovaný nůž. I když to vypadá že by ho neměl kde schovat. Unless he’s fully naked.
