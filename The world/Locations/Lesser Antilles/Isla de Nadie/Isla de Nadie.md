| ---------------------------------- |
- a bunch of shipwrecks everywhere, one of them being Vane's old ship
- Edward England has been surviving on the island for the past years or so as the only survivor or Vane's shipcrash apart from him. He doesn'z know how long it has been or that Vane accepted and then broke the king's pardon or how cruel he became
- stuff on the island does not age or rot or go bad. For example if someone dies on the island, that body will stay looking fresh forever, unless it is removed (in which case the aging process begins once the body leaves the island) or eaten
- the island is inhabited by humanoid carnivorous feathered creatures with feminine appearance (sirens?) that come out at night and sing hypnotic songs with which they can lure any human or animal towards them and then eat them
- night and day cycles work weirdly on the island. Sometimes one island day can last 4-7 normal days, sometimes one island day lasts less than a normal day
- the island is usually surrounded by thick fog and not located on this plane of existence but during some times of the year it can "appear" for a few days before being covered back again
- when the fog wall is intact, it is impossible to escape off the island by normal means (sailing or swimming away), however there is a small spring hidden in a cave in the thick forest of the island that leads to the normal world and through which a person can escape from the island
