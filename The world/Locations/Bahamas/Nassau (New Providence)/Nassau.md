**Nassau**, originally named **Charles Town** and sometimes referred to as **Nassau Port**, was a town and the only port on the island of New Providence. It was the largest commercial center in the Bahamas, a group of islands in the Atlasntic Ocean, close to the Caribbean Sea. Prior to becoming a British colony, during the early 18th century, Nassau served as the main base and stronghold of pirates, including such infamous individuals like [[Edward (Blackbeard) Teach]] or [[John (Calico Jack) Rackham]]
